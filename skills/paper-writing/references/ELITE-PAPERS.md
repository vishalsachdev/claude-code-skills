# Writing Elite Information Systems Papers
## Based on Thatcher's 17 Rules for Elite Journal Papers

This guide distills best practices for writing theoretically grounded, construct-centered, mid-range empirical papers that make clear contributions to elite Information Systems journals (MISQ, ISR, JMIS, JAIS).

## The 17 Rules for Elite Papers

### Phase 1: Framing the Paper

#### Rule 1: Open with Bold Claims or Puzzles
Start with a theoretically meaningful claim or empirical puzzle that anchors your contribution.

**Good Opening:**
"This paper shows that CIO presence, often ignored in emerging markets, substantially predicts a firm's AI orientation."

**Bad Opening:**
"The IS field has long been interested in digital transformation."

**How to Know You're Doing It Well:**
- Your first sentence makes a clear, theoretically meaningful claim
- The introduction passes the "skim test" - readers know what, why, and contribution
- Your introduction and conclusion align - they "rhyme"

#### Rule 2: Use Narrative Hooks
Introduce compelling puzzles, contradictions, or paradoxes early.

**Example:**
"Despite spending billions on AI, many firms fail to adopt it strategically. Why? We show that the answer lies in whether the CIO has a seat at the table."

**How to Know:**
- First paragraph introduces tension/contradiction
- Readers ask "why?" not just "what?"
- The hook reverberates across the manuscript

#### Rule 3: Lead with the Contribution
Every section and paragraph should open with the most important point.

**Good Example:**
"We define IT mindfulness as a user's dynamic capability and validate its influence on task adaptation and feature use."

**Bad Example:**
"With the growing use of information systems, researchers have become increasingly interested in user attitudes."

**Practical Tips:**
- Start with "We found..." not "We ran..."
- Abstract begins with what you do and find, not gaps
- Read only first sentences - does the argument make sense?

#### Rule 4: One Construct, One Paragraph
Each focal construct needs: (a) one-sentence definition, (b) boundary clarification, (c) placement in nomological network.

**Example:**
"IT mindfulness is a user's dynamic capability to notice new information, remain contextually aware, and adjust IT use intentionally."

**Practical Tips:**
- Write definition first, then what it's NOT
- Each construct gets its own paragraph
- Use same label across all sections

#### Rule 5: Thread the Construct
Use the same term, label, and framing throughout.

**Before (Inconsistent):**
- Abstract: "IT mindfulness"
- Theory: "technological awareness"
- Hypotheses: "tech attentiveness"
- Discussion: "IT flexibility"

**After (Consistent):**
- Use "IT mindfulness" everywhere

**Practical Tips:**
- Use Control-F to scan for inconsistencies
- Match terms in hypotheses with figures and tables
- Create style sheet for coauthors

---

### Phase 2: Building the Argument

#### Rule 6: Use Parallel Logic
Follow AB → BC → CD chains. Each paragraph: setup → action → implication.

**Structure:**
- Theory: "IT mindfulness reduces strain and enhances adaptation"
- Hypothesis: "H1: IT mindfulness reduces digital strain"
- Method: "Used IT mindfulness scale (Thatcher et al., 2018)"
- Results: "IT mindfulness significantly predicts lower strain"
- Discussion: "Results support that IT mindfulness buffers stress"

#### Rule 7: Link Back to Mechanisms
Explain WHY effects occur, not just that they occurred.

**Good:**
"The effect of IT identity on feature exploration is driven by internalization: when users see IT as part of who they are, they seek out new capabilities to maintain self-coherence."

**Bad:**
"Users with strong IT identity explored more features."

#### Rule 8: Theorize, Don't Speculate
Turn limitations into boundary conditions. Avoid vague "future research" claims.

**Good:**
"Our findings indicate that IT identity amplifies digital self-efficacy only when organizational structures allow autonomy. Future research could test whether identity-based motivation weakens in highly centralized settings."

**Bad:**
"Future research should examine how IT identity interacts with other factors."

#### Rule 9: Model the Journal
Align tone, structure, and rhetorical flow with target journal exemplars.

**How:**
- Reverse-engineer 3-5 recent papers from target journal
- Map section flow, headings, paragraph function
- Match theoretical cadence and contribution framing

### Phase 3: Executing Methods & Results

#### Rule 10: Frame Empirics as Theory Tests
Report results as tests of mechanisms, not procedures.

**Good:**
"Shielding moderated the effect of stress on performance (β = −.21, p < .01), supporting the idea that real-time capacity dampens strain-related impairment."

**Bad:**
"We ran a regression to test H3 and found a significant effect (p < .05)."

#### Rule 11: The Gordon Davis Rule
Use visuals to show models, results, and robustness checks.

**Requirements:**
- Model figure clearly labeled
- Results table self-contained
- Robustness checks visible
- Captions explain what's tested and how to read

#### Rule 12: Show Everything That Matters
Every robustness check in a table. Every model in a figure. Every citation complete.

**Three-Part Structure:**
1. **Measurement quality** (α/CR ≥ .70; loadings ≥ .60; AVE ≥ .50)
2. **Structural model** (effect sizes + 95% CIs)
3. **Robustness** (alternative specs, subsample tests)

---

### Phase 4: Writing with Clarity

#### Rule 13: Compress Without Hollowing
Write dense, clear prose. Remove redundancy while retaining insight.

**Template:**
Mechanism → effect size + 95% CI → boundary → stability

**Example:**
"Overload increases work–life conflict, lowering mobile IT use (indirect = X, 95% CI [Y, Z]); control weakens this pathway (moderation index = A, 95% CI [B, C]); effects hold across specifications."

#### Rule 14: Avoid Stylistic Clutter
Eliminate hedges, nominalizations, metadiscourse, "shudder quotes."

**What to Avoid:**
- Hedges: "might," "may," "could," "suggests," "appears to"
- Nominalizations: "utilization" → "use"
- Shudder quotes: unnecessary quotes around common terms
- Metadiscourse: "This paper explores..." → "We explore..."

**Hemingway Pass:**
- Short sentences (14-18 words average)
- Active voice (passive <10%)
- Strong verbs, concrete subjects
- One idea per sentence

---

### Phase 5: Surviving Review & Living On

#### Rule 15: Write for Reviewers
Make it easy to say yes. Preempt concerns with clean structure, footnotes, transparent tables.

**How:**
- Clean section headers
- Summary tables for key results
- Footnotes explaining design choices
- Every claim backed by table/figure

#### Rule 16: End with Resonance
Close by reinforcing core contribution. Don't apologize or hedge.

**Good:**
"By showing that CIO presence influences AI orientation, this paper identifies a concrete lever firms can adjust as they confront strategic uncertainty around AI."

**Bad:**
"Although this study has limitations, more research is needed to understand the long-term impact of CIOs."

#### Rule 17: Make the Paper Easy to Teach
Build clarity and portability into your model, construct, and logic.

**How to Know:**
- A colleague can explain your model on whiteboard in 3 minutes
- Your construct definition is memorable
- Instructors could reuse your visuals or examples

### The George Law
"Don't waste your advisor's time. Come prepared. Be clear. Move the work forward."

**Tips:**
- Never submit messy drafts
- Structure every meeting with agenda
- Summarize takeaways after meetings
- Check in frequently, meet purposefully
